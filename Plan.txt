PROJECT VISION: SENTINEL AUDIT - ADVANCED WEB SECURITY SUITE

1. CORE PHILOSOPHY
   To bridge the gap between "Finding Bugs" and "Fixing Bugs" by combining offensive scanning
   with defensive compliance and remediation.

2. ARCHITECTURE
   - Frontend: React.js (User Interface, Dashboards, Reports)
   - Backend: Python Flask (Scanning Engine, Logic, API)
   - Hosting: Vercel (Frontend) + Render (Backend)

3. KEY FEATURES
   A. Shadow API Hunter
      - Problem: Developers leave hidden API endpoints in JavaScript files.
      - Solution: Regex-based crawler that extracts hidden paths (e.g., /api/admin) from .js assets.
   
   B. Compliance Mapper
      - Problem: Managers don't understand technical jargon like "SQLi".
      - Solution: Automatic translation of bugs into legal standards (GDPR, OWASP, PCI-DSS).
   
   C. Developer-First Auto-Fixer
      - Problem: Scanners show the error but not the solution.
      - Solution: Provides static code templates (Best Practices) for every found vulnerability.

5. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY
   - Phase 1: Local Testing (running localhost:3000 and localhost:5000)
   - Phase 2: Deploy Backend to Render.com (Free Tier)
   - Phase 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (Free Tier)
